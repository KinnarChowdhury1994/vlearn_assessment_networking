Functions:

check_subdomains_status(subdomains, domain): This function takes a list of subdomains and a domain name as input and returns a dictionary containing the status (UP or DOWN) of each subdomain.

print_status_table(status_dict): This function takes a dictionary containing subdomain status as input and prints it in tabular format.

main(subdomains): This function is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to enter the domain name, then continuously checks the status of subdomains and prints the status table every minute. It takes the list of subdomains as input.

Example:
Suppose you have subdomains sub1, sub2, and sub3. Running the script will prompt you to enter the domain name, and then it will continuously check the status of these subdomains and print the status table every minute. You can customize the list of subdomains according to your requirements.
